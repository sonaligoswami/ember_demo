Following are the key points which I have covered in my ember demo project

1.Responsive web design for desktop,mobile,tablet views.
2.Used components for header navigation, hero header, Redefining the web, Services, Our Team, Logos, Contact, and footer as specified in the challenge document.
3.Header is fixed for mobile,desktop & tablet views.
4.Used ember-modal-dialog for generating modals (pricing/learn more) ,also avoided close modal on overlay click,added close button to close the modal.
5.Used ember-validations for contact us form validations.
6.Used ember-scrolll-to for scrolling page on click about and contact link
7.Used model data in routes for passing data to components such as services,our team,our clients,packages  instead of static display.
8.Used ember-cli-saas and bootstarp3 for design.
9.Followed current Ember architecture conventions.
